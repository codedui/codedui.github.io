                <h2>LOGO & IDENTITY DESIGN PROCESS</h2>
                <p class="design-process-para">This is the framework that enables me to work more accurately and efficiently. I want to make this as easy for you as possible. I will guide you step-by-step through the process.</p>
                <h5>1. Understanding</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">If you've already worked with me on your brand strategy or you have your own strategy, I have all the information I need to design your logo and basic elements of your identity.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">If you haven't worked with me on your strategy, I send you a set of questions to gather relevant information and save your time. You can answer these questions by email, phone, Skype or in person.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">Your answers will give me a better understanding of :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>who your ideal customers are</li>
                    <li>who your main competitors are</li>
                    <li>what makes you different - unique benefits</li>
                    <li>how you want others to see you.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>2. Research</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">I make additional online and offline research on your company, your competitors and target customers. I analyse designs that have been successful for your competitors and your industry. </p>
                <p class="design-process-step">This allows me to :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>get a broader view of your situation in your market</li>
                    <li>find important information that may have been overlooked</li>
                    <li>avoid creating a logo or identity that is similar to your competitors'</li>
                    <li>discover the most appropriate design direction.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>3. Ideas generation</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">I generate different ideas using mind mapping technique. Next, I sketch to get rid of bad ideas and discover possible directions. If your logo includes a logomark (icon, symbol), I usually start from designing it first. Then I work on your wordmark (logotype, text-only logo).</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">I have to create the logo that will represent your business in the simplest, most appropriate and memorable form. That's why I analyse what will work best for your brand</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">I spend at least a couple of days thinking about a project before I move on to the next stage. I question each step that I have done up to this point. I have to be sure that I've chosen the best directions.</p>
                <h5>4. Drafts</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">I select and digitise my strongest concepts based on their effectiveness. An effective logo is the one that is : </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>simple</li>
                    <li>memorable</li>
                    <li>timeless</li>
                    <li>vesrsatile</li>
                    <li>appropriate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="design-process-step">I choose fonts that express your brand personality and match your logomark. Next, I modify an existing font to make it unique. I explore different arrangements of a logomark and wordmark to see the correlation between them. </p>
                <p class="design-process-step">After that, I need to step back from the project—at least for a day. It helps me to take a look at my ideas from a new perspective, reconsider my decisions and determine what is really important. Then I can make any necessary changes.</p>
                <h5>5. First presentation</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">The more options you have to consider, the harder it is for you to make a choice. This is a phenomenon known as “decision fatigue”. That's why I choose only 3 of the strongest concepts to show you.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">At this stage, I present you only black and white versions in PDF file. This allows you to focus on the idea, not a specific colour. Next, I :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>explain you my thoughts behind each concept</li>
                    <li>give you an insight into why each one works</li>
                    <li>give you guidance on which logo is the best fit for you.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>6. Your feedback</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">Your feedback is crucial to making this process work. You don't need to know anything about design. I give you 3 questions and tell you what you should focus on.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">Don't be afraid to give negative feedback. I won't take it personal. The sooner you let me know that something doesn't work, the better. It will save us time, frustration and I will be able to fix it. </p>
                <p class="design-process-step">In order to meet a project deadline and keep the momentum, we both set a specified time limit (usually 2 days) to provide a short feedback via email. I take your feedback into consideration and, if necessary, make any revisions to the chosen logo design concept.</p>
                <h5>7. Refinement and feedback</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">I perfect the overall visual appeal of your logo and make sure it will work both in large and small sizes. That's why I have to improve <strong>readability</strong> of your logo by adjusting letter spacing. I also make <strong>optical corrections</strong> so that the alignment, shape and size of the various elements of your logo look “right” for the human eye. The design software is not always good at it.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">Then I show you a refined version of your logo and, after your feedback, I make any final adjustments. </p>
                <h5>8. Choosing your colours</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">Once we are both happy with the overall shape of your logo, I help you to choose the most relevant colour palette. Choosing the right colour for your logo is crucial, because it can increase your brand recognition by up to 80%. Your brand colour palette will be based on colours of your logo.</p>
                <p class="design-process-step">The colour of your logo should :</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>set your company apart from its competitors</li>
                    <li>match your company's personality </li>
                    <li>attract your target audience.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="design-process-step">The knowledge of colour theory and psychology of colour in branding helps me to make better choices. I also use the information on your industry gathered during my research. </p>
                <h5>9. Final presentation</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">After you have approved the colour palette, I present you the final version of your logo. To show you how your logo will work in context, I create mock-ups (usually: business card, stationery, signage, mobile phone screen etc.) and on different colour backgrounds.</p>
                <h5>10. Delivery and support</h5>
                <p class="design-process-step">Now we are both satisfied with the result of our collaboration and I'm ready to prepare for you : </p>
